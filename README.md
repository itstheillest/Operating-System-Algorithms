This consists of 3 OS Algorithms. 

1. Preemptive and Non-preemptive CPU Scheduling
2. Fixed Partition
3. Disc Scheduling

This is not a perfect algorithm, especially when it comes to the Fixed partition. The output of the Fixed Parition is flawed by my limited knowledge. I made Fixed Partition from scratch and a few of the Preemp and Non-preemp scheduilng.
I'm gonna use this as my first ever project posted publicly in Github. It's not anything crazy and still a lot of amateur mistakes can be seen. Eitherway, I'm proud of this project.
